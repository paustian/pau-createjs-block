*A Gutenberg block plugin to display animations created using html5 and the createjs library.*
## Description
This plugin is a Gutenberg block that allows the posting of html5 animations created with CreateJS inside any Post or Page. You define the width and height of the area for the animation and point to the location of the javascript. The plugin does the rest.
## Installation
1. In your WordPress Dashboard navigate to "Plugins" then click on the "Add Plugins" button.
2. Search for "Create JS Block".
3. Install the plugin by pressing the "Install" Button.
4. Activate the plugin by pressing the "Activate" button.

Once installed and activated, use the plugin as you would any block. Create a Post or Page. Add a block and search for createjs. On the sidebar, define the location of the javascript used to control the animation relative to your content directory. Define the width and height of the canvas for the animation. If your javascript is functional, you should see your animation playing in the block. You can also add accompanying text to the animation.

If you want to see an example of this used on a live site, check out this animation that demonstrates [Enzymes as Biological Catalysts](https://textbookconsortia.com/enzymes-are-biological-catalysts/).
